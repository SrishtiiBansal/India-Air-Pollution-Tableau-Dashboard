# India-Air-Pollution-Tableau-Dashboard

## Overview
This Tableau dashboard project aims to provide insights into India's air pollution levels using historical daily ambient air quality data released by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and Central Pollution Control Board of India. The dashboard offers a comprehensive analysis of air quality trends over time, geographical variations, key pollutant contributions, and correlations with environmental policy changes.

## Dashboard Components

### 1. Map Visualization:
   - Geographical maps visualizing air quality levels across different states or regions in India.
   - Map markers color-coded based on the air quality index (AQI) or other relevant metrics such as SO2, NO2, RSPM, etc.

### 2. Time Series Charts:
   - Line charts depicting changes in air quality over the years.
   - Data grouped by months or years to identify patterns and trends.

### 3. Policy Change Timeline:
   - Timeline showcasing key environmental policy changes in India.
   - Policy change events highlighted to observe correlations with air quality variations.

### 4. Filter Options:
   - Filters for selecting specific states, periods, or pollutant types.
   - Parameters enabling users to customize their views based on interests or research questions.

### 5. Comparative Analysis:
   - Comparative charts illustrating air quality comparisons between different states or regions.
   - Utilization of bar charts or line charts to represent variations in air quality metrics.

### 6. Top Pollutant Analysis:
   - Identification and display of top pollutants contributing to poor air quality.
   - Use of bar charts or pie charts to represent the proportion of each pollutant.

### 7. Insightful Annotations:
   - Annotations highlighting specific data points, events, or trends in the analysis.
   - Context and explanations provided for these annotations.

## Dataset
- The dataset used in this project is a combined version of the Historical Daily Ambient Air Quality Data released by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and Central Pollution Control Board of India.
- It includes dimensions such as Stn_code, Sampling_Date, State, Location, Agency, location_monitoring_station, pm2_5, Date, and Type, along with measures like SO2, NO2, RSPM, and SPM.

## How to Use
1. **Connect to Data**: Import the provided dataset into Tableau.
2. **Design Dashboard Layout**: Plan and allocate space for each dashboard component.
3. **Create Worksheets**: Develop individual worksheets for each component.
4. **Apply Filters**: Implement filters for interactive exploration.
5. **Implement Interactivity**: Enable interaction between different components.
6. **Timeline Integration**: Integrate the policy change timeline into the dashboard.
7. **Map Integration**: Incorporate the map visualization into the dashboard layout.
8. **Test and Refine**: Thoroughly test the dashboard for functionality and refine based on feedback.
9. **Document Insights**: Document key insights derived from the dashboard analysis.
10. **Publish and Share**: Publish the finalized dashboard to the desired platform.
